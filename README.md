## Development Approach 
 We Use Hybrid app development approach owing to following advantages 
  
    * Hybrid app ports to Multiple platforms :
      Can support multiple platforms although native container should be developed for each platform
       
    * Low Development Costs:
      It is cheaper to develop using hybrid architecture as the development process involves writing a native cotainer over 
      existing presentation layer using third party libraries
    
    * Code Reuse :
       A hybrid app can leverage common server-side components as the same HTML content is exposed for each platform.
    
    * Functional Testing:
       Functionailty tested for one platform should work for all the platforms
      
    
    * Existing Server side Components:
      We can utilise existing server side resources which are designed for Web Application
    
    
    * Enhancements:
       Rolling out new features is easier as no client app distribution is required
